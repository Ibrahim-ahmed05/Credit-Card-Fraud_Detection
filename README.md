# Credit-Card-Fraud_Detection
In this project, I developed a fraud detection system using two machine learning models: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree Classifier. The highly imbalanced credit card transaction dataset was handled using class balancing techniques. Models were trained, evaluated, and compared based on their ROC-AUC scores.
